This project was created as a semester long, team based project. IndieDev is a social media site for Game Developers, Game Designers, Artists, Musicians, and Creatists to collaborate and share concepts/ideas. Furthermore, IndieDev is a web application that allows creators to interact with others in a social media environment. IndieDev provides a space for individual developers to connect with other creators to build/design full-fledged video games. In addition, they’re able to showcase their personal projects for other developers to view. Since IndieDev is a social media site, users will be able to create posts, like, and comment on posts. Also, users can select roles that represent their interest and can direct message each other. Users can have in-depth profiles that’ll highlight their past experiences, projects, and style. By completing this project, the team was able to obtain knowledge on various technological tools that helped create this full-stack application.
