    <p>
      Ever since I was a kid, I've always been fascinated by technology and how
      it works. I would go online and search how different aspects of technology
      worked. Eventually, I started to learn how to code and create my own
      projects. I've always been a creative person and I love to create things
      that people can use and enjoy. I'm always looking for new ways to learn
      and grow as a developer.
