This project was created as a semester long, team based project. IndieDev is a social media site for Game Developers, Game Designers, Artists, Musicians, and Creatists to collaborate and share concepts/ideas. Furthermore, IndieDev is a web application that allows creators to interact with others in a social media environment. IndieDev provides a space for individual developers to connect with other creators to build/design full-fledged video games. In addition, they’re able to showcase their personal projects for other developers to view. Since IndieDev is a social media site, users will be able to create posts, like, and comment on posts. Also, users can select roles that represent their interest and can direct message each other. Users can have in-depth profiles that’ll highlight their past experiences, projects, and style. By completing this project, the team was able to obtain knowledge on various technological tools that helped create this full-stack application.

### My Role:
As a full-stack developer, I created and implemented core server-side functionalities using Java, Spring Boot, and various dependencies. My primary responsibilities included:
- Designing and implementing the MySQL database schema
- Creating RESTful APIs for user management and content operations
- Implementing CRUD functionality for posts, profiles, and portfolios
- Building responsive frontend interfaces using Thymeleaf templates
- Integrating security features and user authentication
- Managing project documentation and API specifications
- Developing moderation and administration tools

### Technical Details:
The backend infrastructure leverages several key technologies:
- Spring Boot framework for:
  - MVC architecture implementation
  - RESTful API development
  - Security configuration
  - Dependency management
- MySQL (Apache XAMPP) for data management:
  - User account information
  - Profile and portfolio data
  - Posts and interactions
  - Messaging system
  - Report management
- Development Environment:
  - IntelliJ IDEA for Java development
  - XAMPP for database management
  - Git for version control

The frontend implementation includes:
- Thymeleaf template engine for:
  - Server-side rendering
  - Dynamic content generation
  - Form handling
- JavaScript functionality for:
  - Real-time interactions
  - Form validation
  - API communication
  - User experience enhancements
