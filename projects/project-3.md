In this website, it was created to demonstrate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills by creating a website that can generate passwords. The user is informed of the inportance on password safety and allows them to generate a password based on their selected options. These selected options can be numbers, special chacracters and uppercase letters.

### My Role:
As a web developer, I created and implemented core web functionalities using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. My primary responsibilities included:
- Designing an intuitive user interface
- Implementing password generation algorithms
- Creating responsive layouts for all screen sizes
- Building client-side form validation
- Implementing copy-to-clipboard functionality

### Technical Details:
The frontend implementation leverages:
- HTML5 for structure:
 - Semantic markup
 - Form elements
 - Accessibility considerations
- CSS3 for styling:
 - Flexbox layout
 - CSS Grid
 - Responsive design
 - Custom animations
- JavaScript functionality for:
 - Random password generation
 - Form validation
 - User input processing
 - Clipboard operations
 - Dynamic UI updates

Development Environment:
- VS Code for development
- Git for version control
- Live Server for testing
