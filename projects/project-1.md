A simple beginner Java Swing application created to explore how to use Java Swing and it's features. In this application, it can count the number of words or count the number of characters in a text file or within the text area. The user can import a text file to the application which will be processed and displayed in the text area.


### My Role:
As an application developer, I created and implemented core functionalities using Java and Java Swing for the UI. My primary responsibilities included:
- Designing an intuitive user interface using Java Swing components
- Implementing file input/output operations
- Creating text processing algorithms for word and character counting
- Ensuring proper error handling
- Building a responsive GUI layout

### Technical Details:
The application leverages several key technologies:
- Java Swing UI Components:
 - JTextArea for text input and display
 - JFileChooser for file selection
 - JButton for action controls
 - JLabel for count displays
 - JPanel for layout organization
 - JScrollPane for text area scrolling
- Java Core Features:
 - File I/O operations
 - String manipulation
 - Event handling
 - Exception handling

Development Environment:
- IntelliJ IDEA for development
- Git for version control
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
